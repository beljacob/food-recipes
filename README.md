# Jacob's Recipes

The amount of time I spent building this project (being my first react project) helped me really understand how some fundamental react concepts work.

Here you can search your favourite meals and filter them by category. 

When clicking on a meal, a modal will pop up with all the detailed info about that meal.

The recipes are fetched from [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/) API.
